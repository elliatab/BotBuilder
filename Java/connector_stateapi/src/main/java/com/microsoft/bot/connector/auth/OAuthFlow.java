/**
 * Microsoft Bot Connector API - v3.0
 * The Bot State REST API allows your bot to store and retrieve state associated with conversations conducted through  the [Bot Connector REST API](/en-us/restapi/connector). The Bot State REST API uses REST and HTTPS to send and receive  encoded content that your bot controls.    Client libraries for this REST API are available. See below for a list.    Your bot may store data for a user, a conversation, or a single user within a conversation (called \"private\" data).  Each payload may be up to 32 kilobytes in size. The data may be removed by the bot or upon a user's request, e.g.  if the user requests the channel to inform the bot (and therefore, the Bot Framework) to delete the user's data.    The Bot State REST API is only useful in conjunction with the Bot Connector REST API.    Authentication for both the Bot State and Bot Connector REST APIs is accomplished with JWT Bearer tokens, and is  described in detail in the [Connector Authentication](/en-us/restapi/authentication) document.    # Client Libraries for the Bot State REST API    * [Bot Builder for C#](/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/)  * [Bot Builder for Node.js](/en-us/node/builder/overview/)  * Generate your own from the [State API Swagger file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/master/CSharp/Library/Microsoft.Bot.Connector/Swagger/StateAPI.json)    Â© 2016 Microsoft
